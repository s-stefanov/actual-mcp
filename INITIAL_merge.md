## FEATURE:

The current branch is a merge from a Fork of my repository.
I would like to introduce these changes to the main branch.

- Merge main branch into this branch
- There will be a lot of merge conflicts - understand each one of them and make separate plan to resolve them
- Validate diff of branch comparing to main - it should not remove any functionality and should comply with latest changes in main branch
- There are new introduction of Type checking and ESLint - validate that the codebase is compliant with these new tools

## EXAMPLES:


## DOCUMENTATION:

Initial Pull Request https://github.com/s-stefanov/actual-mcp/pull/13

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- This is a Fork merge. It should not leave any traces of the user who created the fork
- It should comply with the current branch and policies
- README file should be updated to reflect the changes or fixes if the Fork made unnecessary changes
