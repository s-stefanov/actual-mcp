## FEATURE:

I would like to create a new Github action that will execute on Pull Request and will validate the code is building, formatted correctly/linted and tests are passing.

- Should also prepare the add of ESLint, but for now only commented out

## EXAMPLES:

@see examples/github-actions-ci-cd-best-practices.instructions.md for GitHub Actions CI/CD best practices instructions for AI coding assistants

## DOCUMENTATION:

- Search documentation for GitHub actions and Node.js actions
- Use context7 when needed for up-to-date external documentation

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- Should run only on PR
- Should validate if needed to update release checks
