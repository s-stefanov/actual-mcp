# Plan for Implementing release-please

This plan outlines the steps to implement automatic deployment and submission with GitHub Actions using `release-please`.

- [x] ## 1. Prerequisites

- [x] Analyze the project's commit history to determine if it follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. `release-please` relies on this standard to automatically determine version bumps and generate changelogs.

- [x] ## 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

- [x] Create a new workflow file at `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.

- [x] ## 3. Workflow Configuration

- [x] Configure the workflow to trigger on pushes to the `main` branch.
- [x] The workflow will use the `google-github-actions/release-please-action@v4`.
- [x] Configure the action to be a `node` release type since you have a `package.json` file.

- [ ] ## 4. Initial Pull Request

- [ ] After setting up the workflow, the action will create a "release PR" with the initial version bump and changelog.

- [ ] ## 5. Merging and Release

- [ ] Once you merge the release PR, the action will automatically create a GitHub release, tag the commit, and publish the new version.
