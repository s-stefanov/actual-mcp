### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Follow the existing TypeScript project structure** and maintain consistency with established patterns.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For Actual MCP server, this looks like:
  - **Main server** (`src/index.ts`): MCP server initialization and transport setup.
  - **MCP Integration**: Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for server implementation.
  - **Actual Budget API** (`src/actual-api.ts`): Manages the connection lifecycle to Actual Budget data.
  - **Tools** (`src/tools/`): Each tool follows a consistent modular pattern:
    - `index.ts`: Schema definition and main handler.
    - `input-parser.ts`: Argument validation and parsing.
    - `data-fetcher.ts`: Data retrieval from external API.
    - `report-generator.ts`: Output formatting.
    - `types.ts`: Tool-specific type definitions.
  - **Core Utilities** (`src/core/`): Shared functionality for data fetching, input handling, aggregation, and mapping.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use process.env** for environment variables.

### üß™ Testing & Reliability

- **Always create Vitest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, modules, etc).
- **Use TypeScript in tests** and maintain type safety throughout test suites.
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should be co-located** with source files using `.test.ts` naming convention.
  - Example: `src/core/data/fetch-accounts.ts` ‚Üí `src/core/data/fetch-accounts.test.ts`
- **Use proper ESM module mocking** with `vi.mock()` for external dependencies.
- **Test commands available**:
  - `npm run test` - Run all tests once
  - `npm run test:unit:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports
  - `npm run test:ui` - Open Vitest UI for interactive testing
- **Include comprehensive test coverage**:
  - 1 test for expected use (happy path)
  - 1 edge case (boundary conditions)
  - 1 failure case (error handling)
  - Mock external dependencies (actual-api.js, etc.)
- **Follow existing test patterns** in `src/core/` for consistency.

### ‚úÖ Task Completion

- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

### üìé Style & Conventions

- **Use TypeScript** as the primary language with strict type checking.
- **Follow ESLint and Prettier** configuration for consistent code formatting.
- **Use explicit type annotations** for function parameters and return types.
- **Prefer interfaces over types** for object shapes when possible.
- **Use JSDoc comments for complex functions** following TypeScript conventions:

  ```typescript
  /**
   * Brief summary of the function.
   *
   * @param param1 - Description of the parameter
   * @returns Description of the return value
   */
  function example(param1: string): Promise<Result> {
    // implementation
  }
  ```

- **Use `npm run build`** to compile TypeScript and **`npm run watch`** for development.
- **Follow Node.js/npm conventions** for package management and scripts.

### üìö Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified npm packages.
- **Check package.json dependencies** before using any external libraries.
- **Use Context7 for up-to-date library documentation** when working with external packages or APIs.
- **Maintain backward compatibility** when making changes to existing APIs or interfaces.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.

### Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

#### File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
gemini command:

#### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

**Or use --all_files flag:**
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

**Implementation Verification Examples**

Check if a feature is implemented:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

Verify authentication implementation:
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

Verify error handling:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

Check for rate limiting:
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

Verify caching strategy:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

Check for specific security measures:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

Verify test coverage for features:
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

#### When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:

- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

#### Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
