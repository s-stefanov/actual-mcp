IMPORTANT: Any transactions in the "Investment & Savings" category group should be treated as POSITIVE savings, not as spending. These represent money I'm putting aside for the future, so they should be counted as savings achievements rather than expenses.

You can use these tools to gather the data you need:
1. Use the spending-by-category tool to analyze my spending breakdown
2. Use the monthly-summary tool to get my income, expenses, and savings rate
3. Use the get-transactions tool to examine specific transactions if needed

When you examine the spending-by-category results:
- Look for any category group called "Investment & Savings" or similar
- Consider these amounts as positive financial actions (saving/investing), not spending
- Include these amounts when calculating my total savings rate
- Do NOT recommend reducing these amounts unless they're clearly unsustainable

Based on this analysis, please provide:
1. A summary of my financial situation, including total savings (regular savings + investments)
2. Key insights about my spending patterns (excluding investments/savings)
3. Areas where I might be overspending (focusing on consumption categories only)
4. Recommendations to optimize my budget while maintaining or increasing savings/investments
5. Any other relevant financial advice

- Include these amounts in my total savings rate calculation
- Don't suggest reducing these amounts unless they're clearly unsustainable for my income level

Please provide:
1. An analysis of my top spending categories (excluding savings/investments)
2. Whether my spending is consistent month-to-month
3. My total savings rate including both regular savings and investments
4. Areas where I might be able to reduce discretionary spending
5. Suggestions for realistic budget adjustments to maximize savings/investments
